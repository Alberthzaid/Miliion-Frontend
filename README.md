# Frontend app using React + TS + Vite🧑‍💻

In the following repository, I present my front-end application using React + TS + Vite. I used Tailwind CSS and Shadcn to implement styles, aiming to offer the best visual experience for the user.

My approach was aimed at decoupling the code by layers, so that services, hooks, and components could have their own independent spaces, thus promoting best practices and ensuring scalable development.
